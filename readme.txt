== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with PHP 8 =

Yes, it's actively tested and working up to PHP 8.2.

= Do you accept donations? =

I am accepting sponsorships via the GitHub Sponsors program: https://github.com/sponsors/quentin-ld/. If you work at an agency that develops with WordPress, ask your company to provide sponsorship in order to invest in its supply chain. The tools that I maintain probably save your company time and money, and GitHub sponsorship can now be done at the organisation level.

In addition, if you like the plugin then I'd love for you to leave a review. Tell all your friends about it too!
